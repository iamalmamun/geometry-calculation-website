    <h2>What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h2>
    <p>DOM = Document Object Model.(DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that
        programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and
        objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.</p>
